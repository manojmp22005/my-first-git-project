What is a Repository (Repo)?

A repository is just:

A normal folder that Git watches and tracks.

Before Git:

myProject/


After Git:

myProject/  ← Git tracks changes here

🔹 Step 1: Create a project folder

Go to Desktop

Create a new folder

Name it:

my-first-git-project

🔹 Step 2: Open this folder in Git Bash

Right-click inside the folder

Click Git Bash Here

You will see a black terminal window.

🔹 Step 3: Initialize Git

Type this command:

git init

What this does

It tells Git:

“Start tracking this folder.”

You will see:

Initialized empty Git repository


✅ Now this folder is a Git repository

🔹 Step 4: Create your first file

Inside the folder:

Create a file called:

hello.txt


Open it and write:

Hello, this is my first Git project!


Save the file.

🔹 Step 5: Check Git status

Back in Git Bash, type:

git status


You will see something like:

Untracked files:
  hello.txt

Meaning

Git sees the file, but is not tracking it yet.
