What is a Repository (Repo)?

A repository is just:

A normal folder that Git watches and tracks.

Before Git:

myProject/


After Git:

myProject/  ← Git tracks changes here

🔹 Step 1: Create a project folder

Go to Desktop

Create a new folder

Name it:

my-first-git-project

🔹 Step 2: Open this folder in Git Bash

Right-click inside the folder

Click Git Bash Here

You will see a black terminal window.

🔹 Step 3: Initialize Git

Type this command:

git init

What this does

It tells Git:

“Start tracking this folder.”

You will see:

Initialized empty Git repository


✅ Now this folder is a Git repository

🔹 Step 4: Create your first file

Inside the folder:

Create a file called:

hello.txt


Open it and write:

Hello, this is my first Git project!


Save the file.

🔹 Step 5: Check Git status

Back in Git Bash, type:

git status


You will see something like:

Untracked files:
  hello.txt

Meaning

Git sees the file, but is not tracking it yet.

⚠️ Common mistakes & fixes
❌ Mistake 1: git init in wrong folder

Fix:
Go to correct folder and run git init again.

❌ Mistake 2: Can’t see “Git Bash Here”

Topic 5 — Understanding Changes: status, diff, and log

Now that you’ve made your first commit, it’s time to see what changes in your code and track history confidently.

In this topic you’ll learn:

How to check what changed

How to see differences in files

How to read commit history

🔹 1. git status — your best friend

Run this anytime:

git status


It tells you:

What files changed

What is staged

What is not staged

What is ready to commit

Example output meaning
Message	Meaning
Untracked files	Git sees file but not tracking
Changes not staged	File changed but not added
Changes to be committed	Ready to save
🔹 2. Make a small change

Open hello.txt
Add a new line:

I am learning Git step by step.


Save the file.

Now run:

git status


You’ll see:

modified: hello.txt

🔹 3. See what exactly changed — git diff

Run:

git diff


You’ll see something like:

+ I am learning Git step by step.

Meaning

+ → new line added

- → line removed

This shows difference between last commit and now.

🔹 4. Save the change
git add hello.txt
git commit -m "Update hello message"

🔹 5. See history — git log
git log


Shows:

All commits

Who made them

When

With what message

If log looks long, exit with:

q

⚠️ Common mistakes & fixes
❌ Mistake 1: git diff shows nothing

Reason: File already staged
Fix:

git diff --staged

❌ Mistake 2: Forgot what you changed

Fix:
Always run:

git status
git diff


before committing.

❌ Mistake 3: Too many logs

Fix:

git log --oneline

📝 Practice Task

Do this now:

Open hello.txt and add one more line

Run:

git status


Run:

git diff


Save it:

git add hello.txt
git commit -m "Add second line"


View history:

git log --oneline


Then reply:

Done
or
I got this error: ___
